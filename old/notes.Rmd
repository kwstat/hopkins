todo: Create an example with two-dimensional scatterplot that is highly correlated, so only 1 cluster.

Notes on public literature and code related to Hopkins statistic.

"fixme" means I should contact the authors to suggest corrections.

# R

## factoextra

These two examples are from the `factoextra::get_clust_tendency` function, which uses a copy of the `clustertend::hopkins` code and therefore (incorrectly) uses d=1. fixme

```{r}
library(factoextra)
get_clust_tendency
get_clust_tendency(iris[,-5], n = 50)
# use hopkins( d=1 ) to match
hopkins::hopkins(iris[,-5], m=50, d=1)

# Random uniformly distributed dataset (no inherent clusters)
set.seed(123)
random_df <- apply(iris[, -5], 2, 
                   function(x){runif(length(x), min(x), max(x))}
                   )
get_clust_tendency(random_df, n = 50)
hopkins::hopkins(random_df, m=50, d=1)
```

## spatstat.core

Seems to be correct for 2-column data. Probably not for 3-column data etc. fixme

The code for `hopskel` is abstracted, so hard to read, but it appears to use d=2.  Also, the function calculates `A=mean(dX^2)/mean(dU^2)`.  We can convert to the `hopkins::hopkins` scale via 1/(1+A).

Help page says: "The function hopskel calculates the Hopkins-Skellam test statistic A, and returns its numeric value. This can be used as a simple summary of spatial pattern: the value H=1 is consistent with Complete Spatial Randomness, while values H < 1 are consistent with spatial clustering, and values H > 1 are consistent with spatial regularity."

```{r}
pacman::p_load(spatstat.core)
# https://rdrr.io/cran/spatstat.core/src/R/hopskel.R
# https://rdrr.io/cran/spatstat.core/man/hopskel.html
plot(redwood)
hopskel(redwood) # .186 to .223 indicates strong spatial clustering
hopskel.test(redwood, alternative="clustered") # p-value .00001

# Using .20 from hopskel, we can re-scale it to 1/(1+.20) = 0.83,
# which is close to what the hopkins package gives
hopkins::hopkins( as.data.frame(redwood), m=10) # .780 to .835
```

## parameters

The code seems to be taken from clustertend::hopkins and likely uses d=1.
fixme

library(parameters)
check_clusterstructure(iris[, 1:4])
```

Interesting discussion of Hopkins and Holgate indexes.  I cannot find any code for calculating the Holgate index, so this could be an interesting addition. fixme

Original post asks "Is there any history of R packages causing wrong results?".  fixme

Contact Adolfsson and explain error with hopkins().  Post on reddit with possible problem.

Uses factoextra.  fixme
